# Google Cloud TPU Hands-on

Cloud TPU hands-on repo with the sample notebooks to train NLP and Computer Vision models using TPU as an accelerator. 

The notebooks are based on [Keras code samples](https://keras.io/examples/) with some changes to use other datasets (french language) and Cloud TPU instead of GPU.

This code was tested in Google Cloud Platform enviroment.
